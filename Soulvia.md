## When choosing a Soulvia
Players will understand the meaning through text and images, which is the path to the root of the soul. Players must choose the most suitable path from six completely different Soulvias. Each path has different levels, which are skill points. To unlock each level, players need to pay a certain amount of enlightenment points.
