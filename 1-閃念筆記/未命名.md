There are three gear lubrication methods in general use:
(1) Grease lubrication. 
(2) Splash lubrication (oil bath method). 
(3) Forced oil circulation lubrication. 
The choice of lubricant and method depends upon tangential speed (m/s) and rotating speed (rpm).Â [1]

**Splash Lubrication:**
Splash Lubrication:
Splash Lubrication is an older system used to lubricate both engines and gears. In engine applications, scoops on the big-ends of the connecting rods dip into the oil sump and splash the lubricant upwards towards the cylinders, creating an oil mist that settles into droplets. The oil droplets then pass through drillings to the bearings, thereby lubricating the moving parts[4]. 

In gear applications, this method involves submerging the gears in an oil bath. As the gears rotate, they splash the oil around the gearbox, ensuring lubrication of the components[1][2].

**Circulating Lubrication:**
Circulating Lubrication is a system used for both engines and gears, in which oil is pumped through the components and then returned to a reservoir. In engine applications, this method provides better lubrication than splash lubrication because it ensures a constant flow of oil to all parts of the engine[2]. 

For gears, circulating lubrication involves pumping oil through the gearbox, with the oil being cooled and filtered before being reintroduced into the system[1].

**Jet Lubrication:**
Jet Lubrication is a system used for both engines and gears, where oil is sprayed onto the components using high-pressure jets. In engine applications, this method provides better lubrication than splash lubrication because it ensures a constant flow of oil to all parts of the engine[3]. 

For gears, jet lubrication effectively distributes oil to the gear surfaces, ensuring proper lubrication and reducing wear[1][2].

In terms of gearboxes, Splash Lubrication is not recommended because it does not provide enough lubrication throughout the gearbox. Circulating Lubrication and Jet Lubrication are both better options for gearboxes because they provide better lubrication and can help prevent wear and tear on the gears[2][3]
